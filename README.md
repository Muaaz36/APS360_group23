# APS360_group_Project

Have you ever created something but someone else has taken credit for it? Or seen the image of a famous character on YouTube, but the creator hasnâ€™t given the proper acknowledgement to the company who owns the character?

Copyright infringement has been one of the most serious problems that have hampered the development of the entertainment industry. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of existing image classification and search services, these infringements have not been properly identified, and the number of infringements has increased over the years. To tackle this issue, we propose a photo classification AI with a scope on Disney cartoon classics.

Our project topic stemmed from a collective group interest in cartoons and a desire to find a way to address copyright related to the misuse of these cartoons in the media. The reason we chose Disney cartoons is that not only do these hold fond memories of our childhood, but they have more authentic data available. Because of this, many of these characters have become mainstream, and therefore, animation companies need a way to protect their cartoon characters from copyright violations.

A machine learning algorithm that is useful for classifying images is Convolutional neural networks, and we will use pre-trained weights as tools to achieve our goal.
